Apple is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of June\\xa02022[update], is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft.\\n\", \"Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by  Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\\n\", 'As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple\\'s unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching \"Think different\" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company\\'s product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\\n', \"Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1\\xa0trillion in August 2018, then $2\\xa0trillion in August 2020, and $3\\xa0trillion in January 2022. As of January 2023[update], it was valued at around $2.2\\xa0trillion. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\\n\", 'Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[6][9] The company\\'s first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[10] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[11]:\\u200a57\\u200a[a] Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[12] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[13] It went on sale soon after debut for US$666.66 (equivalent to $3,175 in 2021).[14][15]:\\u200a180\\u200a Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[16]\\n', 'Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[17][18] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded Apple.[19] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of US$250,000 (equivalent to $1,117,930 in 2021) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[20] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118\\xa0million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[21]\\n', 'The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[22] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[23][24]\\n', 'The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[23] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office.[23] Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.[25] By the end of the 1970s, Apple had become the leading computer manufacturer in the United States.[26]\\n', 'On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6\\xa0million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September\\xa03, 2022[update]),[18] generating over $100\\xa0million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[27] By the end of the day, 300\\xa0millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[28] and a market cap of $1.778\\xa0billion.[27][28]\\n', \"A critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[29] shares (22.4\\xa0million split-adjusted shares as of September\\xa03, 2022[update])[18] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[30] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[31]\\n\", 'The Lisa division would be plagued by infighting, and in 1982 Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software titles.[32]\\n', \"Jobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[33] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[34]\\n\", 'In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language.[35] Its debut was signified by \"1984\", a $1.5\\xa0million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[36] This is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple\\'s success[37] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN[38] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide.[39]\\n', 'The advertisement created great interest in the original Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had made the decision to equip the original Macintosh with 128 kilobytes of RAM, attempting to reach a US$1,000 (equivalent to $2,608 in 2021) price point, which limited its speed and the software that could be used. The Macintosh would eventually ship for US$2,495 (equivalent to $6,508 in 2021), a price panned by critics in light of its slow performance.[40]:\\u200a195\\u200a In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[41] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[42] Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[43]\\n', 'The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley\\'s direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.[44] Informed by Jean-Louis Gassée, Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple\\'s executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[44] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took a number of Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[45] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple\\'s treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years.\"[34][46][47] Despite Wozniak\\'s grievances, he officially remained employed by Apple, and to this day continues to work for the company as a representative,[46] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year for this role.[15] Both Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures.[48]\\n', 'After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak, Sculley worked to improve the Macintosh in 1985 by quadrupling the RAM and introducing the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[49] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[50]\\n', 'This dominant position in the desktop publishing market[51] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to Jean-Louis Gassée\\'s mantra of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[52]:\\u200a79–80\\u200a\\n', \"This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on PC clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh, but at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[52]:\\u200a117–129\\u200a During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[53] Gassée left the company later that year.[54]\\n\", 'The company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[55] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\\n', '\\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[56] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[57]', \"The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of their higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra models, the mid-range Centris line, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.[59]\\n\", 'The early 1990s also saw the discontinuation of the Apple II series, which was expensive to produce, and the company felt was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II.[60] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[61]\\n', 'Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with its Windows graphical user interface that it sold to manufacturers of generally less expensive PC clones. While the Macintosh was more expensive, it offered a more tightly integrated user experience, but the company struggled to make the case to consumers.\\n', \"Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video game consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Most notably, enormous resources were invested in the problem-plagued Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[62]\\n\", 'Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[63] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.[64] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.\\n', \"The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[65]\\n\", \"With Spindler at the helm, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. The same year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's PowerPC processor.[66]\\n\", 'In the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[67]\\n', 'In 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[68]\\n', 'This period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this with by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but the company still felt it needed a more modern approach.[69] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that same year, Copland in 1994, and the attempted purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, demanded $300 million instead of the $125 million Apple wanted to pay.[70]\\n', \"Only weeks away from bankruptcy,[71] Apple's board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.[72]\\n\", \"The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[73] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\\n\", 'The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company\\'s products. Jobs would order 70% of the company\\'s products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.[74] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150\\xa0million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.[75] The investment was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices.[76] Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[77] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.[78]\\n', 'The moves paid off for Jobs, at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.[74]\\n', 'On May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success for Apple selling 800,000 units in its first five months[79] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1⁄2-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[80] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. The device also had a striking teardrop shape and translucent materials, designed by Jonathan Ive, who although hired by Amelio, would go on to work collaboratively with Jobs for the next decade to chart a new course the design of Apple\\'s products.[81][82]\\n', 'A little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook, a laptop for consumers. It was the culmination of a strategy established by Jobs to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, along with the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs felt the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[83]\\n', \"At around the same time, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired of Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.[84] The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[85] Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple would sell as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product, and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[85] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, while simplifying the user interface and adding the ability to burn CDs.[86]\\n\", '2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company.\\n', 'The first announcement came on March 24, 2001, that Apple was nearly ready to release a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. The announcement came after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X was based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, with Apple aiming to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface, heavily influenced by NeXTSTEP. To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[87]\\n', \"In May 2001, the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California,[88][89] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[90] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[91] but they went on to become highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[92]\\n\", 'On October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100\\xa0million units sold within six years.[93]\\n', \"In 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered music downloads for 99¢ a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[94] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[95]\\n\", \"\\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[96] as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.[97] The release of iPhoto in the same year completed the iLife suite.[98]\", \"At the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[99] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[99] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[100] On April 29, 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[101] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[102]\\n\", 'Apple\\'s success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple\\'s stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[103] When Apple surpassed Dell\\'s market cap in January 2006,[104] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell\\'s CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[105] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[106]\\n', 'During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as \"Apple Inc.\", because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[107] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[108] and the Apple TV.[109] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[110] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".[111]\\n', \"In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[112] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[113] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[114]\\n\", 'In July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[115] Within a month, the store sold 60\\xa0million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1\\xa0million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[116] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[117]\\n', 'On January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".[118] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16\\xa0billion and profit of $1.21\\xa0billion.[119]\\n', 'After years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[120] In May of the same year, Apple\\'s market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[121]\\n', \"In June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[122] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[123] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[124]\\n\", 'On January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs\\'s day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain \"involved in major strategic decisions\".[125] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[126] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple\\'s previous attempt at content syncing.[127] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.\\n', \"On August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[128] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[129] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D.

In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[274][275]\\n', 'British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[276] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[277]\\n', 'According to a US Senate report on the company\\'s offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[278] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple\\'s retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said.[279]\\n', \"On May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[280]\\n\", 'Apple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[281] In an interview with the German newspaper FAZ in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[282]\\n', 'In 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple\\'s use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history.

FedEx today is best known for its air delivery service, FedEx Express, which was one of the first major shipping companies to offer overnight delivery as a flagship service. Since then, FedEx also started FedEx Ground, FedEx Office (originally known as Kinko\\'s), FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Freight, and various other services across multiple subsidiaries, often meant to respond to its main competitor, UPS.

       " \"FedEx's primary competitor in the United States and most of its international destinations is United Parcel Service (UPS). Both companies employ generally similar strategies; both companies' largest hubs for its air delivery are in the southern United States (Memphis for FedEx and Louisville for UPS), both offer overnight, 2-day, and ground delivery as default options, both frequently use Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport for trans-pacific shipments,[33] and both of their main hubs are some of the world's busiest airports by cargo traffic. FedEx's other main competitor is the United States Postal Service (USPS), as USPS offers an overnight service (Priority Mail Express), a 2-5 day service (Priority Mail), and an economy/ground service (First Class, Parcel Select Ground). To a lesser extent in the US, FedEx competes with SF Express and DHL, and while DHL's market share in the United States is rising, the shipping industry (not including USPS) in the United States is primarily dominated by UPS and FedEx; DHL is only a strong competitor to FedEx outside of the United States.[34]\\n\",\n",

       " 'The FedEx logo is a wordmark designed in 1994 by Lindon Leader of Landor Associates, of San Francisco.[37] It consists of Fed in purple and Ex in orange. The FedEx wordmark is notable for containing a subliminal right-pointing arrow in the negative space between the \"E\" and the \"X\", which was achieved by designing a proprietary font, based on Univers and Futura, to emphasize the arrow shape.[37] Leader believed the logo promoted FedEx as \"getting from point A to point B reliably with speed and precision\".[38]\\n',\n",
       " 'In the early 2000s, the Ex was in a different color for each division and platinum for the overall corporation use. However, in August 2016, FedEx announced that all operating units would adopt the purple and orange color logo over the next five years (the same as the original FedEx logo, and later used by FedEx Express).[39]\\n',\n",

FedEx's shares traded at over $273 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$2,459 billion in December 2020.[51] FedEx ranked No. 50 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[52]\\n\",\n",
       " \"In early March 2021, FedEx announced plans to make its operations carbon-neutral by 2040.[53] It's investing $2 billion in sustainable energy initiatives, including $100M for a new Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture and upgrading its aircraft and ground transportation fleets.[54] It will be the first customer to take delivery of GM's electric Zevo delivery vans, as part of the goal of an all-electric ground fleet by 2040.[55]\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nFedEx's initiatives to be carbon-neutral by 2040 will allow them to reduce their negative contributions to climate change drastically, however they may fall short of this goal. As mentioned in their 2021 10-K filling,[56] they are at risk of being unable to achieve being carbon neutral by 2040 due to potential inability to execute the business operations as planned. Such risks are the costs associated with vehicle electrification and renewable energies. Additionally, the pace at which research and technological developments occur at pose a threat to FedEx's goal. \\n\",\n",
       " \"FedEx's current practices have allowed them to avoid several amounts of emissions. Their current fleet of electric vehicles and more efficient delivery routes have avoided roughly 950,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

Reversing a 1994 decision which allowed FedEx to classify its operatives that own their own vehicles as independent contractors, the IRS audited the years 2003 to 2006, with a view to assessing whether similar misclassification of operatives had taken place. FedEx denied that any irregularities in classification had occurred, but faced legal action from operatives claiming benefits that would have accrued had they been classified as employees.[64]\\n',\n",
       " 'In June 2009, FedEx began a campaign against UPS and the Teamsters union, accusing its competitor of receiving a bailout in an advertising campaign called \"Brown Bailout\". FedEx claimed that signing the Federal Aviation Administration re-authorization bill, which would let some of its workers unionize more easily (and, according to the Memphis-based company, \"could expose [its] customers at any time to local work stoppages that interrupted the flow of their time-sensitive, high-value shipments\"),[65] was equivalent to giving UPS a \"bailout\". Independent observers heavily criticized FedEx\\'s wording,[65] claiming that it was \"an abuse of the term\".[65] FedEx Express employees are regulated under the Railway Labor Act.[66]\\n',\n",
       " 'In July 2020, the Air Line Pilots Association International (ALPA), the union that represents FedEx Corp pilots, called for a suspension on the company\\'s Hong Kong operations. According to the union, some members were subject to \"extremely difficult conditions\" at hospitals urged by government mandates due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[67] FedEx was criticized more broadly for providing inadequate protections and sick leave during the pandemic.[68]\\n',\n",
